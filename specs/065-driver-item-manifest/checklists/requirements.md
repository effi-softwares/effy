# Specification Quality Checklist: Driver Item Manifest & Temperature Classes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The PRD's one open point (do drivers see items for standard packages they only carry to the hub)
  is resolved as an assumption: yes, at pickup. Revisit with `/speckit-clarify` if the client
  disagrees.
- FR-010 goes beyond the PRD: orders placed before this feature show the class as "not recorded"
  rather than Normal, so a frozen item is never mislabelled.
